# Perpsidian

Use [PerplexityAI](https://perplexity.ai) inside the Obsidian.MD app

Basicly what i did here is using unofficial api wrapper written by [nathanrchn](https://github.com/nathanrchn/) in python, so you have to install it.

## Installation

First of all, install Python 3.12.0>. After that, run following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nathanrchn/perplexityai.git
```

Now install Perpsidian:

1. Go to releases page and download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `main.py`
2. Create folder in {{obsidian_vault}}/.obsidian/plugins
3. Put those files here
4. Restart Obsidian
5. **You're done!**

## Usage

At the moment there's two commands you can see in Command Pallete (`ctrl+p`)

1. Perpsidian: Prompt selection
2. Perpsidian: Prompt selection (return with links)
3. Perpsidian: Prompt every line in selection
4. Perpsidian: Prompt every line in selection (return with links)

First command will replace your selection with answer from Perplexity, second will do the same thing but adds links following the answer below.

## Example usage

# Obsidian.MD advantages over notion

Obsidian and Notion are both popular note-taking tools, each with its own advantages. Here are some key advantages of Obsidian over Notion:

- **Complete control over data**: Obsidian allows you to store all of your notes locally, while Notion is only available as a cloud-hosted solution.

- **Customization**: Obsidian offers the ability to customize your workspace to your specific needs, and it uses a knowledge graph structure to connect notes through bi-directional thinking.

- **Pricing**: Obsidian offers all of its features for free forever for personal use and charges only $50 per person per year for commercial use, which is significantly less than Notion's pricing.

However, it's important to note that Notion is great for team collaboration, project management, and note-taking, and it offers more project management features and templates than Obsidian. Therefore, the choice between Obsidian and Notion depends on your specific needs and preferences.

# Why the Cola tastes better that Pepsi?

The difference in taste between Coca-Cola and Pepsi can be attributed to their ingredients. Coca-Cola does not contain citric acid and uses phosphoric acid instead, giving it a smoother, more mellow flavor with a vanilla profile. On the other hand, Pepsi contains citric acid, which gives it a more citrusy and tart flavor, making it sweeter and more zesty with an upfront zing. Some people prefer Pepsi due to its sweeter taste, while others prefer the smoother flavor of Coca-Cola.
