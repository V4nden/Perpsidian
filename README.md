# Perpsidian v1.0

Use [PerplexityAI](https://perplexity.ai) inside the Obsidian.MD app

Basicly what i did here is using unofficial api wrapper written by [nathanrchn](https://github.com/nathanrchn/) in python, so you have to install it.

## Installation

First of all, install Python 3.12.0>. After that, run following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nathanrchn/perplexityai.git
```

**And that's all!** Now clone 'Perplexity' folder into your obsidian plugins folder and restart the app!

## Usage

At the moment there's two commands you can see in Command Pallete (`cmd+p`)

1. Perplexity API: Prompt selection
2. Perplexity API: Prompt selection (return with links)

First command will replace your selection with answer from Perplexity, second will do the same thing but adds links following the answer below.

## Example usage

Imagine you selelected 'What is Obsidian.MD?' in your editor and one of the commands, here's what you got then:
